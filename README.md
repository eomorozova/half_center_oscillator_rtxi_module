This is a module for [RTXI](http://rtxi.org/) that creates a half-center oscillator circuit out of two neurons, by connecting them with artificial reciprocal inhibitory synapses and adding hyperpolarization-activated inward currents. This module also simulates negative leak current to counteract the leak induced by the electrode penetration. It also simulated neuromodlatory cirrent (IMI), with the votage dependence similar to the one of NMDA current.

Synaptic current is given by the following equations:

Isyn=gsyn∙s(Vpre)∙(Vpost-Esyn);   (1-s∞ )∙ds/dt=(s∞-s)/τs 

Hyperpolarization-activated inward current (H-current) is given by the following equations:

IH=gH∙r(V)∙(V-EH); 	dr/dt=(r∞-r)/τr

Neuromodulatory current is given by the following equation:

IMI=gMI∙m(V)∙(V-EMI); 	dmi/dt=(m∞-m)/τm

Parameters for the synaptic and H-currents are taken from Sharp et. al, 1996 paper. Parameters for the neuromodulatory current, IMI, are taken from the Swensen et. al, 2001 paper.
